# End-effector
This task is about redesign the end efforts that we used on this repo [here](https://github.com/MonaAl-Dawsari/connect-robot-arm) the purpose that we need is to pop a balloon that's why we will redesign the end efforts to be sharp.
## Get the arm
You can find the Gripper [here](https://github.com/smart-methods/arduino_robot_arm/tree/main/robot_arm_pkg/meshes/stl)
## redesign by Tinkercad
After Get the Gripper we need to import to the Tinkercad.
Then add cylinder shape to the edge, we need to change the state of the shape from solid to be a hole. Then group its together. In this way we cut some part of the Gripper to be sharper. As showing on the pictures.
